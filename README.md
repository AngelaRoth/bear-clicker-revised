# Bear Clicker: After

The "after" version of my [original bear clicker app](https://github.com/AngelaRoth/bear-clicker) as designed for Udacity's Front-End Nanodegree. This version:
* Attempts to separate the Model from the View.
* Adds a pop-up Admin Zone which allows you to change the stats of the currently selected bear.

## How to View it

The site is hosted through [GitHub](https://angelaroth.github.io/bear-clicker-revised/), but right now the **hosted site is not the up-to-date version** because I still have an outstanding question on the Udacity Discussion Forum.

To see the up-to-date site, you'll have to download the master branch and view index.html on your local browser.

## How to Use it

Choose a Bear by clicking on their name. Then, give the bear salmon by clicking the bear's picture.

Selecting a new bear will not make previously clicked bears lose their salmon, but refreshing the screen will revert all salmon counts to zero.

Click the Admin button to pop-up the Admin Zone.
